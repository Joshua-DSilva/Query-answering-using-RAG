            "But talking to teachers gives one the opposite idea – that there are too many changes imposed on them without much consultation or the necessary preconditions for successfully implementing change. Assessing the success of companies in the private sector by profit, sales or growth is widely accepted: ultimately they have a single bottom line which prevails over any other objectives. Ideally, innovation indicators in the education sector should be linked to specific social and educational objectives such as learning outcomes, cost efficiency, equity or public satisfaction. Austria, Belgium Flemish Community, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and u nited Kingdom refer to REFLE x (2005). However, given that we cannot directly observe whether any of these changes are an “improvement”, it has had to depart from the Oslo Manual definition and use change as a proxy measure. Creating options can improve outcomes, but, when dealingwith markets, special care should be taken to ensure that equity is not sacrificed for the sake of efficiency.

Those left behind on the analogue side of the divide may not be able to improve their productivity at work or participate fully in civic affairs. Disadvantaged students spend at least 15 more minutes per day on line during weekends than advantaged ones in Belgium; Germany; Korea; Shanghai, China; Switzerland and Chinese Taipei. A further 4.7% of adults did not have the basic skills that were assessed by the ICT core test, Yet we know that almost half of our teachers desire more training than they currently receive in using technology effectively. Feedback from the field indicated that the previous five-year update cycle was not frequent enough to account for rapidly changing circumstances and the pace of technology advancement in our schools. Learners who successfully develop this ability lay the foundation for lifelong, self-directed learning.11 OFFICE OF Educational TechnologyFOS TERING GROWTH MINDSET: TECHNOLOGY-BASED PROGRAM Principal Dawn Clemens of Stuart-Hobson Middle School saw increases in read - ing scores for their seventh-grade students after using the program. Meeting once a week in two-hour sessions, a non-content expert librarian helps facilitate a peer-learning environment, with the goal that after six weeks the Learning Circles become self-sustainable. The LRNG platform is designed with the goal of creating tools that transform how young people recognize and access opportunities for learning. Students who earn badges can use these credentials when applying for the city’s summer youth internship and employ - ment program. Educators can access programs such as the Google Expedition Pioneer Program for lessons and additional resources to create virtual field trip experiences. As speakers play the sounds of an earthquake, the students can take readings on simulated seismographs at different loca - tions in the room, inspect an emerging fault line, and stretch twine to identify the epicenter. The zSpace program’s noble failure feature allows students constructing a motor or building a battery to make mistakes and retry, learning throughout the process. Modern public buildings include features such as ramps, automatic doors, or braille on signs to make them accessible by everyone. Developed with support from the U.S. Department of Education, the tools listed here were designed to help educators implement UDL principles into classroom practice and make learning activities more accessible: • The Information Research Corporation developed eTouchSciences, an integrated software and hardware assistive technology platform to support STEM learning among middle school students with (or without) visual impairments. The UDL guidelines help educators determine what strategies, accessible technologies, and teaching methods will enable all students to achieve lesson goals. Realizing that some students were not taking part in class discussions, the teacher used technology to provide multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. This tool is a free, openly-licensed,web-based platform that provides step- by-step guidance and analysis dashboards for conducting quick-turnaround evalua - tions of educational technologies. These evaluations can also inform efforts to continually improve education technology interventions by helping educators and researchers quickly learn how technologies have affected student outcomes. After a discus - sion of elevation, the two teachers engaged their students in a competition to see which class could boil water faster.

            "In recent years an increasing number of countries have committed to achieving net zero emissions By April 2022 131 countries covering 88 of global greenhouse gas emissions had announced net zero targets Anthropogenic emissions have already led to a global temperature increase of 1 1 C compared to pre industrial levels There is a broad understanding that net zero by 2050 is imperative to increase the chances of keeping this temperature increase to within 1 5 C This renewed focus means that emissions from all the energy end uses need to be mitigated While energy efficiency electrification and renewables can achieve 70 of the mitigation needed hydrogen will be needed to decarbonise end uses where other options are less mature or more costly such as heavy industry long haul transport and seasonal energy storage Considering these applications hydrogen could contribute 10 of the mitigation needed to achieve the IRENA 1 5 C Scenario and 12 of final energy demand Hydrogen is produced on a commercial basis today it is used as a feedstock in the chemical industry and in refineries as part of a mix of gases in steel production and in heat and power generation Global production stands at around 75 MtH2 yr as pure hydrogen and an additional 45 MtH2 yr as part of a mix of gases This is equivalent to 3 of global final energy demand and similar to the annual energy consumption of Germany Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier not an energy source It can be produced from multiple feedstocks and can be used across virtually any application see Figure 1 Renewable electricity can be converted to hydrogen via electrolysis which can couple continuously increasing renewable energy with all the end uses that are more difficult to electrify This coupling also allows electrolysers to provide flexibility to the grid complementing alternatives such as batteries demand response and vehicle to grid in smart electrification As at the end of 2021 almost 47 of the global hydrogen production is from natural gas 27 from coal 22 from oil as a by product and only around 4 comes from electrolysis Electricity had a global average renewable share of about 33 in 2021 which means that only about 1 of global hydrogen output is produced with renewable energy Electrolytic hydrogen from dedicated production remained limited to demonstration projects adding up to a total capacity 0 7 GW in 2021 In contrast the 1 5 C Scenario would need 4 5 TW by 2050 requiring a faster rate of growth than that experienced by solar photovoltaic PV and wind to date Hydrogen use as an energy carrier remains limited and is principally limited to road vehicles By June 2021 more than 40 000 fuel cell electric vehicles were in circulation around the world with almost 90 of those in four countries Korea the United States the People s Republic of China and Japan By the end of 2020 there were about 6 000 fuel cell electric buses 95 of Fossil Fuels Renewables Electricity Low

combustion engines over 200 years ago to becoming an integral part of the modern refining industry It is light storable energy dense and produces no direct emissions of pollutants or greenhouse gases But for hydrogen to make a significant contribution to clean energy transitions it needs to be adopted in sectors where it is almost completely absent such as transport buildings and power generation The Future of Hydrogen provides an extensive and independent survey of hydrogen that lays out where things stand now the ways in which hydrogen can help to achieve a clean secure and affordable energy future and how we can go about realising its potential Supplying hydrogen to industrial users is now a major business around the world Demand for hydrogen which has grown more than threefold since 1975 continues to rise almost entirely supplied from fossil fuels with 6 of global natural gas and 2 of global coal going to hydrogen production As a consequence production of hydrogen is responsible for CO2 emissions of around 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year equivalent to the CO2 emissions of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined The number of countries with polices that directly support investment in hydrogen technologies is increasing along with the number of sectors they target There are around 50 targets mandates and policy incentives in place today that direct support hydrogen with the majority focused on transport Over the past few years global spending on hydrogen energy research development and demonstration by national governments has risen although it remains lower than the peak in 2008 Hydrogen can be extracted from fossil fuels and biomass from water or from a mix of both Natural gas is currently the primary source of hydrogen production accounting for around three quarters of the annual global dedicated hydrogen production of around 70 million tonnes This accounts for about 6 of global natural gas use Gas is followed by coal due to its dominant role in China and a small fraction is produced from from the use of oil and electricity The production cost of hydrogen Better luck next time Laura Cozzi, Dennis Hesseling, Paolo Frankl, Tim Gould, Keisuke Sadamori, Hiro Sakaguchi, and A raceli Fernandez Pales provided valuable, strategic guidance during the report’s development process. The development of this report benefitted from contributions provided by the following IEA colleagues: Ana Alcalde Bascones, Carl Greenfield , Ilkka Hannula, Luca Lo Re, Jennifer Ortiz , and Nikoo Tajdolat. Only 4% of this potential production has at least taken a final investment decision (FID), a doubling since last year in absolute terms (reaching nearly 2 Mt). China is poised to further cement its leading position in electrolyser deployment: the country accounts for more than 40% of the electrolysis projects that have reached FID globally. This is hindering investment decisions for planned projects whose economic feasibility depends on public support, a situation that has worsened due to the impacts of inflation. Several fertiliser plants reduced their production output or even stopped operations for prolonged periods of the year, reducing hydrogen use by nearly 6% in the region. China was the only major refining region that reduced its demand for hydrogen (around 0.5 Mt) due to a decrease in refinery throughput as a consequence of extensive pandemic -related mobility restrictions . Notes: CCUS = carbon capture, utilisation and storage; FID = projects that have at least taken a final investment decision; GHR 2022 = Global Hydrogen Review 2022; NZE = Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. However, the near -term outlook is positive, as projects able to produce more than 600 kt of low- emission hydrogen are already under construction or have taken an FID. We estimate that these projects could supply an additional 0.7 Mt of hydrogen to industrial consumers by 2030 if they can secure off -takers for all their potential production. Cummins also revealed a concept hydrogen combustion truck, suggesting that India may be the market most suited to this approach, which was later echoed in announcements by Tata Motors and JBC. In the United Kingdom (Saltend ), a project aims to refurbish an existing 1 200 M W natural gas -fired combined heat and power plant for 30% hydrogen co- firing by 2027. • The State Power Investment Corporation (China) is working on a demonstration project to test pure hydrogen firing in a 1.7 MW gas turbine by the end of 2023. Under these options, some costs are borne by taxpayers rather than consumers, but for users this can offer a faster path to scale up and reach cost parity. Carbon credits can complement other funding sources for low- emission hydrogen initiatives, in a similar way to what is happening with direct air capture and storage projects . Announced: in March 2023 the United Kingdom launched a consultation on measures to prevent carbon leakage risk, including public procurement of industrial products such as steel and cement. For the Industrial Deep Decarbonation Initiative, it is assumed that all 9 currently member countries make a pledge to use 10% low -emission steel in their public procurement. Only the\n"

            "But talking to teachers gives one the opposite idea – that there are too many changes imposed on them without much consultation or the necessary preconditions for successfully implementing change. Assessing the success of companies in the private sector by profit, sales or growth is widely accepted: ultimately they have a single bottom line which prevails over any other objectives. Ideally, innovation indicators in the education sector should be linked to specific social and educational objectives such as learning outcomes, cost efficiency, equity or public satisfaction. Austria, Belgium Flemish Community, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and u nited Kingdom refer to REFLE x (2005). However, given that we cannot directly observe whether any of these changes are an “improvement”, it has had to depart from the Oslo Manual definition and use change as a proxy measure.

Disadvantaged students spend at least 15 more minutes per day on line during weekends than advantaged ones in Belgium; Germany; Korea; Shanghai, China; Switzerland and Chinese Taipei. A further 4.7% of adults did not have the basic skills that were assessed by the ICT core test, such as the capacity to use a mouse or scroll through a web page. This means they can only use familiar applications to solve problems that involve few steps and explicit criteria, such as sorting e-mails into pre-existing folders.

The initiative will also be supported by the private sector through new philanthropic investments of more than u SD 60 million from companies such as Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce.org. Last but not least, the initiative also recognises that students must be equipped with strong computational thinking skills and the ability to solve complex problems. At the lower end of the scale, students performing below Level 2 are able to complete only the easiest digital reading tasks in the PISA 2012 assessment, if any.

In their assessment of the literature on computer-assisted instruction, Hattie and Yates (2013) report stronger effects when computers were supplementing traditional teaching, rather than seen as its alternative. Beuermann, D.W., J. Cristia, S. Cueto, O. Malamud and Y. Cruz-Aguayo (2015), “One laptop per child at home: Short-term impacts from a randomized experiment in Peru”, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, vol. It considers five models of how teaching can be supported by technology: 1) educational gaming, 2) online laboratories, 3) technology-enabled collaboration, 4) real-time formative assessment and 5) technological support for skills-based curricula, using examples from the Hewlett Packard Catalyst Initiative project. How can technology-supported learning help to move beyond content delivery and truly enhance innovative education so that students develop a broad mix of skills? The City Academy Norwich in the u nited Kingdom created a virtual world simulation to teach middle school students the intertwined relationships between energy demand, finance and the environment (Box 4.5). Simulations may be less expensive than experimental hardware, although “little empirical data exists on the actual costs of providing online laboratory access at scale” (Jona et al., 2011). One part of the 30-student test group “were given a dynamic environmental problem to solve [in small groups] by sitting around a table and discussing their actions”. The model includes a peer-assessment component – expected also to act as a motivator for students – based on an automatically calculated rating of the problem generation and solving process. In contrast, assessments that are poorly aligned with standards and curriculum make it “impossible to draw valid conclusions about the success of student learning” (Looney, 2011b). Many digital resources are also freely available to teachers: these include simulations in virtual environments (remote or online laboratories, games) and software for real-time formative assessment. ●Fully online courses can be taken by students living anywhere in the world provided thatthey have an interface (e.g. computer, phone, handheld device), the necessary softwareapplications and access to the Internet. While success is driven by pedagogy, technology-supported models generally require a certain level of equipment although mainly relatively low-cost and familiar devices such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, with Internet connections. Many digital resources are also freely available to teachers: these include simulations in virtual environments (remote or online laboratories, games) and software for real-time formative assessment.

This information should be interpreted with caution as the estimates are based on the publishing sector and, in the case of Japan, limited to the school market. This means there are few resources to build upon, and in particular no common market boundaries used by the different actors when they publish accounts or review Yet we know that almost half of our teachers desire more training than they currently receive in using technology effectively. Feedback from the field indicated that the previous five-year update cycle was not frequent enough to account for rapidly changing circumstances and the pace of technology advancement in our schools. Learners who successfully develop this ability lay the foundation for lifelong, self-directed learning.11 OFFICE OF Educational TechnologyFOS TERING GROWTH MINDSET: TECHNOLOGY-BASED PROGRAM Principal Dawn Clemens of Stuart-Hobson Middle School saw increases in read - ing scores for their seventh-grade students after using the program. Meeting once a week in two-hour sessions, a non-content expert librarian helps facilitate a peer-learning environment, with the goal that after six weeks the Learning Circles become self-sustainable. The LRNG platform is designed with the goal of creating tools that transform how young people recognize and access opportunities for learning. Students who earn badges can use these credentials when applying for the city’s summer youth internship and employ - ment program. Educators can access programs such as the Google Expedition Pioneer Program for lessons and additional resources to create virtual field trip experiences. As speakers play the sounds of an earthquake, the students can take readings on simulated seismographs at different loca - tions in the room, inspect an emerging fault line, and stretch twine to identify the epicenter. The zSpace program’s noble failure feature allows students constructing a motor or building a battery to make mistakes and retry, learning throughout the process. Modern public buildings include features such as ramps, automatic doors, or braille on signs to make them accessible by everyone. Developed with support from the U.S. Department of Education, the tools listed here were designed to help educators implement UDL principles into classroom practice and make learning activities more accessible: • The Information Research Corporation developed eTouchSciences, an integrated software and hardware assistive technology platform to support STEM learning among middle school students with (or without) visual impairments. The UDL guidelines help educators determine what strategies, accessible technologies, and teaching methods will enable all students to achieve lesson goals. Realizing that some students were not taking part in class discussions, the teacher used technology to provide multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement. This tool is a free, openly-licensed,web-based platform that provides step- by-step guidance and analysis dashboards for conducting quick-turnaround evalua - tions of educational technologies. These evaluations can also inform efforts to continually improve education technology interventions by helping educators and researchers quickly learn how technologies have affected student outcomes. After a discus - sion of elevation, the two teachers engaged their students in a competition to see which class could boil water faster. McKay recognized that her students were searching for the language to talk about complicated issues of race, gender, power, and equity. While reflect - ing on this unit, McKay wrote: “We were not only working to promote tolerance and appreciation for diversity in our community. Texas teacher Janelle Bence was looking for new ways to engage and challenge her students, the majority of whom are English language learners from low-income fami - lies. Effective use of technology is not an optional add-on or a skill that we simply can expect teachers to pick up once they get into the classroom. In the program’s pilot year, the first 80 teachers recorded hundreds of videos using tools such as Swivls, iPads, high-definition webcams, and microphones. In addition, not a single teacher from the pilot group left Denver Public Schools after their year with Project Cam Opener (the overall district rate of turnover is 20 percent). Adequate connectivity will increase equitable access to resources, instruction, expertise, and learning pathways regardless of learners’ geography, socio-economic status, or other factors that historically may have put them at an educational disadvantage. The Alliance for Excellent Education’s Future Ready website provides one example of free online assessment tools to be completed by district teams. John Carver, Superintendent of Howard-Winn Community School District, faced less than optimal conditions when he initiated a digital learning transformation project modeled on Future Ready Schools. The approach has spread beyond mathe - matics instruction into other subjects as well, setting a tone and track for the district’s growing STEM initiative. Not only is this latter decision cost- effective but it provides students and staff with high-quality, up-to-date resources for learning. In contrast, formative assessments are frequent, instructionally embedded checks for under - standing that provide quick, continual snapshots of student progress across time. At the same time, in-service teachers can benefit from ongoing profes - sional development on the integration of technology to enhance their teaching. Problems can be situated in real-world environments, where students perform tasks, or include multi-stage scenarios that simulate authentic, progressive engagement with the subject matter. In a mathematics class, a performance task might ask students to analyze a graph based on actual data and describe the linear rela - tionship between the quantities. For tasks that require hand scor - ing, scores can be merged with machine-scored items in the same system, thus providing complete test results. Similarly, assistive technology, such as text-to-speech, alternate response systems, and refresh - able braille, supports students with disabilities in accessing learning. Because adaptive tests target content and test items aligned with each student’s ability level, the adaptation leads to more precise scores for all students across the achievement continuum in a greatly reduced time period. Achieving the same level of precision in a traditional paper- and-pencil test would require students to answer many more questions, potentially impacting instructional time. SimCityEDU: Pollution Challenge!, one of GlassLab’s digital games, provides educators with the tools and content to engage students in real-world challenges faced by countries globally. Providing meaningful, actionable information that is collected across all of these systems will require agreement on the technical format for sharing data while attending to student privacy and security. “It was really difficult to track where my students were on their progress towards meeting a learning objective and giv - ing them timely feedback,” says Elizabeth Doggett, a teacher at Summit Public Schools. The development of micro-credentials is one approach to address this need by creating a shared language and system for communicating success in developing these competencies. BadgeOS , the open source environment for setting up progressive creden - tialing programs, has been installed more than 30,000 times by organizations around the world and supports millions of learners. More detailed information and guidance can be found in the U.S. Department of Education’s Future Ready Schools: Building Technology Infrastructure for Learning . initiative’s impact on the 10 pilot Lighthouse Schools.1 Although the report contains early baseline data, findings sug - gest that these schools are beginning to reflect the goals of S.T.A.T. From the outset, the district viewed technology as a means to close achievement gaps between high-need, underserved student populations and historically higher performing students. The Choctaw Nation Tribal Area has demonstrated how—through a combination of grants, loans, and dona - tions—private industries can bring critical access to these underserved communities. Technology also can assist in the easy translation of these policies into other languages, providing a bridge to communication that otherwise might leave some families disconnected. If policies and procedures for the use of devices are too strict, they often have unintended negative consequences, such as preventing access to legitimate educational resources. Adequate connectivity will increase equitable access to resources, instruction, expertise, and learning pathways regardless of learners’ geography, socio-economic status, or other factors that historically may have put them at an educational disadvantage.

emissions Only 4 5 of countries have achieved carbon neutrality and most countries are still planning to do so by 2050 2070 Moreover synergies between different countries have hampered synergies between adaptation and mitigation policies as well as their co benefits Here we present a strategy to reach a carbon neutral economy by examining the outcome goals of the 26th summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties COP 26 Methods have been designed for mapping carbon emissions such as input output models spatial systems geographic information system maps light detection and ranging techniques and logarithmic mean divisia We present decarbonization technologies and initiatives and negative emissions technologies and we discuss carbon trading and carbon tax We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy and the development of low carbon technologies low carbon agriculture changing dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste Developing resilient buildings and cities introducing decentralized energy systems and the electrification of the transportation sector is also necessary We also review the life cycle analysis of carbon neutral systems Sam Fankhauser Stephen M Smith Thom Wetzer Meimei Kang Wenwu Zhao Yanxu Liu Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript With the increasing global industrialization and over exploitation of non renewable energy sources a large number of greenhouse gases have been released leading to an increase in global temperature and causing a series of environmental degradation issues Wang et al 2021 From pre industrialization around 1850 until 2022 the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide CO2 concentration increased substantially from 285 to 419 ppm Chen 2021 CO2 Daily 2022 As a result the United Kingdom meteorological office estimates a global average surface temperature increase of about 0 97 to 1 21 C throughout 1850 2022 with a central estimate of 1 09 C they also predict that 2022 will continue the trend of the warmest years in the world Sangomla 2022 Furthermore global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise by 50 by 2050 owing primarily to CO2 emissions from non renewable energy use Rabaey and Ragauskas 2014 Without effective measures or technologies to reduce or control CO2 emissions the global average atmospheric CO2 concentration as well as the global surface and ocean temperatures will continue to rise The rising global temperature caused by these greenhouse gases has already caused significant damage to the human living environment including the extinction of some species loss of biodiversity droughts floods forest fires ocean acidification melting of north and south pole glaciers NSPG and sea level rise Maximillian et al 2019 Mora et al 2018 Yang et al 2022 In response to rising global greenhouse gas concentrations and temperatures on December 12 2015 197 member parties of the United Nations framework convention on climate change UNFCCC unanimously agreed at the Paris climate change conference PCCC to adopt the Paris agreement which lays out plans for global action to address climate change after 2020 Berndes et al 2016 Under the Paris agreement each country agreed to limit the global temperature increase to less than 2 C and work to limit the global temperature increase to less than 1 5 C Agreement 2015 As of February 2021 124 countries worldwide have declared their intention to become carbon neutral and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or 2060 Chen 2021 To attain the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement and support sustainable development it is necessary to not only reduce CO2 emissions but also to remove CO2 from the atmosphere to achieve net zero carbon or negative carbon emissions through various social economic environmental and technological measures Carbon neutrality a state of net zero carbon emissions can be achieved by balancing the total amount of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions produced directly or indirectly by a country company product activity or individual over a certain period via carbon offset or removal initiatives Furthermore to achieve carbon neutrality the intergovernmental panel on climate change IPCC in its special report on global warming of 1 5 C also emphasized the need to reduce and phase out fossil fuels use more renewable energy improve energy efficiency and highlighted the importance of implementing these measures in cities to achieve carbon neutrality Masson Delmotte et al 2018 Moreover to achieve net zero carbon emissions and sustainable development carbon removal or sequestration in terrestrial and marine ecosystems must be promoted Cheng 2020 Different regions countries and cities have developed strategies to improve carbon removal or sequestration and achieve carbon neutrality Hepburn et al 2021 Pedersen et al 2020 Huang and Zhai 2021 yet achieving net zero carbon

Parties for achieving carbon neutrality specifically addressing the implications of achieving such a target by 2050 or 2060 for most member countries Furthermore the review explores global initiatives primarily referring to the policies or measures put in place by individual countries to achieve net zero carbon emissions The review also investigates in detail the interrelationships and synergies between adaptation and mitigation strategies maps direct and indirect carbon emissions and proposes two main approaches to achieving carbon neutrality emissions reduction and atmospheric carbon removal Moreover the review presents carbon free plans for the future in transportation agriculture food waste industry and other areas and examines the life cycle analysis of various carbon neutral systems for the technologies or measures to achieve these plans Finally the review provides relevant and up to date information policies and technologies for achieving carbon neutrality and assists governments and people in different regions and countries in understanding the positive environmental social and economic consequences of carbon neutrality At a critical time for green recovery on a global scale the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties was held in Glasgow from 31st October to 12th November 2021 Masuda et al 2022 It is well known that greenhouse gas emission reductions are a key factor in human health The 2030 enhanced emission reduction targets in the form of nationally determined contributions and the mid century long term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies that the worldwide governments are supposed to submit to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties have only been submitted by countries accounting for 55 and 32 of global greenhouse gas emissions respectively Wyns and Beagley 2021 At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties climate change moved from a marginal issue to a worldwide priority With the attention of world leaders government representatives businesses and citizens focused on the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow expectations are high for countries to make new commitments on reducing carbon emissions In the meantime it is essential to look back at another United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties For the first time ever a major event occurred in 2015 At the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties every country agreed to combat the negative impacts of climate change by working together to keep global warming in a range well below 2 C with a target value of 1 5 C Vogler 2020 At the same time each nation party agreed to provide funding to achieve these goals van den Berg et al 2022 This marked the birth of the Paris agreement The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties made progress in four key areas coal cars cash and trees Progress in the first two goals requires a consensus among countries to rapidly phase out coal the most polluting fossil fuel The second is to replace fuel based transport with electric transport as soon as possible and to develop electric vehicles Regarding the latter two goals the 100 billion in annual financial support pledged by developed countries to developing countries in 2010 will have to be delivered At the same time climate change solutions which are part of the biology of global change should be implemented and delivered Smith et al 2022 Figure 1 presents the four main outcomes of the

In other words, at a national level, age ncies are not ma king d ecisions to acquir e technology b ased on do minant policing phil osophies or the activi ties they prioritize . Perhaps not surpri singly automated records management system s (RMS) and computer- aided dispa tch (CAD) we re the technology credited with having t he greatest impact on police agencies nationwi de. Qualitative data from site visits are used to provide further conte xtual information about how local situat ional chara cteristics, su ch as crime issues, pro mpt the ado ption of speci fic technologies. However, the existing lite rature o n organizational choice provides a us eful starting point a nd an overarching the oretical framework b ecause it describes four perspectives of understanding how organizations identify and ac hieve agency goals. Despi te discussio ns within the cri minal justice arena about policing mode ls and their impact on law enforcement activities (Moore & Tro janowicz, 1988; Wei sburd & Braga, 20 06), o ur review indicated that very little research h as been conducted on associations betw een different views about common pol icing strategies and the acqui sition or perceived impact of This resource was prepared by the author(s) using Federal funds provided by the U.S. Department of Justice. Notwiths tanding wide spread co njecture a bout how so cial media is used b y law e nforcement, there have been few attempts to address this issue systematically. Results indicated that officer s perceived numerous ben efits of in -car camera systems, incl uding increased age ncy accountabil ity, im proved co mmunity pe rceptions, and en hanced office r- related be havio rs (i.e ., professionalism). For instance, results from a randomized controlled experiment in Mesa, Arizona, conducted by PERF indicated no relationship between the number of scanned license plates and vehicle theft rates (Taylor, Koper, & Woods, 2011). Rece nt estimates suggest that a bout o ne-third of lo cal police departments use BWCs, althoug h these numbers are expe cted to i ncrease substa ntially in the future (Reaves, 2015). T he pol icing strate gies inquire d abo ut wer e as follows: pr ofessional, community, problem-oriented, z ero-tolerance, hot-spot, offende r targeting, int elligence-led, and pre dictive po licing. 1Hawaii does not have a stat e police agency.Section 5 — Research Design 5-7mailed reminder letter was se nt with a targe ted expl anation of the im portance o f the pro ject and its be nefit to sma ll age ncies. For example, one agency reporting ha ving im pleme nted an LPR s ystem on the survey, but it was learned duri ng the screening c all that they had recently deco mmissioned the system . Final ly, we assess aspects rel ated to t he ide ntifica tion, acqui sition, and adopti on of technology throug h in-depth, semistructu red discussio ns with agency representatives . Because of sma ll cell sizes for tribal and st ate police/highway patro l agencies, we re coded agency type into a singl e dumm y variable compari ng mun icipal police departments with all others. O ther activities conside red most criti cal included tar geting h igh-risk are as (47% of responde nts identified this activity in their top five), e ngaging the community (35%), stoppi ng an d questio ning s uspici ous per sons (31%) , and arresting p ersons for minor cri mes (25%) . However, early ado pters had gene rally depl oyed these devices to speci alized posi tions such as traffic deta ils or duri ng major events (e.g ., protests, sporting eve nts). Ag encies also discussed t he de sire to expa nd capabilities th at were technology centric but not associ ated with speci fic hardwar e purchase or acquisi tion. Having mo re sworn o fficers was associated with g reater use of GIS, data mining, social me dia, and LPR technol ogy in t he last 2 years. Consisten t with the pre ceding tabl es, within the full sample there was little relat ionsh ip between strategy an d overall nu mber of technological de vices used in the past 2 years. Rather, key factor s that influence d technol ogy adoption were more commonly re lated to com munity issues (i.e., local political clim ate, gover nment policies, dem ands for transparency), agency leadership, and tec hnical infrastruc ture a nd capabilities. Social media was excl uded beca use it s acquisi tion process is subs tantially differ ent from other t echnology (e.g., the start-up costs are typically minimal; they do not require integration into se cure data systems). In disc ussions with officers, IT per sonnel , and depa rtment leadership (see Appen dix B), individ uals descr ibed th e push to purs ue a t echnology a s com ing fr om either the top down or the bot tom up. At least nine o f the age ncies we visited, mo st of which were high-impact agencies, formed working groups to expl ore particula r technol ogy an d cond ucted pilot stu dies or te sting in the field. A number of agencies recommended i nvesting more money in t he initial purch ase to cre ate a robust system with l ower maintenance co sts and longer shelf life. Having in -house tec hnical capa city at differ ent levels facilitated impl ementation acr oss sites but was al so discussed as a particula rly important factor for certain technology. At this agency, a nd other sites with invested leadership, car e and emphasis was placed on the acq uisition pro cess, leading to t he purchase of robust systems that eased implementation. In som e instances, the chief reco gnized that they were not the most technologically savvy person and designa ted someone to act as the key tec hnology stra tegist for the department. A few agencies stresse d office r accountability as a tool to se t expecta tions for a technology and pr event disus e. In one ag ency, this meant having the chief mand ate that all officers use a tech nology. Site visit data illustrate d that public pressure can drive the in itial consideratio n of new technology, particula rly for ca r cameras or BWCs, which are tied to contem porary discussio ns around community -based policing. In other words, at a national level, age ncies are not ma king d ecisions to acquir e technology b ased on the ir dominant policing phil osophies or the activities they prioritize . As pre viously noted , automa ted records management system s (RMS) and computer- aided dispa tch (CAD) we re the technology credited with having t he greatest impact on police agencies nationwi de. Popular atte ntion has turned toward more trendy technol ogy, such as drones and BWCs, bu t software found in the CAD/RMS s ystems sti ll represents a critical technology to a broad range of age ncies. We heard fro m sm aller age ncies that inform ation-sharing pla tform s, for example, were more important fo r shari ng info rmation with ot her agencies rath er than sharing information intra- agency. The per ceived impact of differ ent technologies that are identified, acquire d, and implemented in a pol icing agency varies tremendously a nd this var iation has an effect o n the ado ption process. Give n the importance o f obtai ning buy-in from officers when making cha nges in pol icing, it seems equally important to fully integra te any technological changes into t he established strate gies and actio ns of office rs. The success me trics for tec hnology such a s CAD/RMS ma y be di fficult to ide ntify in adva nce without car efully conside ring how the technology will impact the agency. Recommen dations There are several recommendations for the steps the policing com munity ca n take to cre ate an envir onment of more success ful tech nology acq uisition and use that stem from this project. This la ck of knowle dge made it difficult to implement technology in a way that links t hat technol ogy with departmental goa ls, organization al cultu re, and pol icing strategies. A robust program of intern al evaluation may ameliorate this possi bility by helping to expl ain why the technol ogy was a failure and set up a roadmap for similar future technology.

Missing: Table | Show results with:Table.Page: Climate change Summary: In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming. Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change. Many climate change impacts have been felt in recent years, with 2023 the warmest on record at +1.48 °C (2.66 °F). Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil. Page: Carbon dioxide Summary: Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CO2. It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It is found in the gas state at room temperature, and as the source of available carbon in the carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 is the primary carbon source for life on Earth. In the air, carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation, acting as a greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater, lakes, ice caps, and seawater. When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate (HCO−3), which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO2 levels increase.It is a trace gas in Earth's atmosphere at\n",
